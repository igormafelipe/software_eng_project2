Pawn class and factory implemented

Try implementing board, and adding the pawns in.

Got board and pawn working, as well as pawn factory. Tested it too.


Currently implementing bishop and a helper function that will check diagonals from a location. It will also check horizontals (so the queen and tower can use it)

Diagonal currently bugging: Not sure what is going on, print statements do not help. Complaining about illegalArgument. Maybe the reconversion from two ints to a location is bad?? idk
